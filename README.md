# CatFork!
 
This is an app I built as my capstone project at the Austin Coding Academy in the second half of 2017. I used JS6, HTML5, CSS3, Babel and JSX using the React library to deliver a recipe search experience based on enterable ingredients. The process relies on 2 API calls. The substance or "fork" is the call to the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com) api, querying the ingredients and returning the recipes. The second is the "cat" from the [catApi](https://www.thecatapi.com) ...because the internet.
