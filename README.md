# CatFork!
 ![alt text](src/images/CatForkTitleSmall.png) I put the logo together using GIMP
 
This is an app I built as my capstone project at the Austin Coding Academy in the second half of 2017. I used JS6, HTML5, CSS3, Babel and JSX using the React library to deliver a recipe search experience based on enterable ingredients. The process relies on 2 API calls. The substance or "fork" is the call to the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com) api, querying the ingredients and returning the recipes. The second is the "cat" from the [catApi](https://www.thecatapi.com) ...because the internet. 

I am in the process of migrating the app to Firebase so these pictures will have to satisfy your curiosity for now.

That's CatFork! An excellent excercise in the handling of API calls and URL variables using javascript and the React libary.
Not a bad recipe app either. I'm expanding the functionality to include:
* Login/User Base - this is in process using Google Auth  - 
* Favorite Recipe/Cats Folders
* Expanding Search Functionality To Include Nutritional Info, Cusine, Ingredient Substitution
* Ingredient/Recipe Conversion, Including Pan-Size Adjustment For Things In Rimmed Pans! (something I've always wanted)
* Long Term is adding the ability to create your own recipe and minting an ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Token as a way to memorialize it and the ability to add it to the Catfork Recipe Vault.
