# Cat Fork Rises!


## The beginning of a refactor

This was the capstone project I completed while attending the Austin Coding Acadamy. I figured it's time for an overhaul.

## the Breakdown

*  Cat Picture
  - Redux is already in the app So I'll just keep a cat picture in there and cycle on button press

* Recipe Search
  - This is already in redux, I'll clean up the logic and the styling a little. 

* Fetch Individual Recipe
  - Styling and a bit of refactor here, going to expand a bit.
