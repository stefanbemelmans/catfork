# Catfork!

This is my capstone project for the Austin Coding Academy. It is a recipe Search App written in React, using MongoDB and the redux framework, that is powered by the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/) API.

The user enters one or more comma separated ingredients and is returned a list of recipes containing those ingredients.

There is also a dynamic picture of a cat provided by [CatApi](https://thecatapi.com/) that can be changed on a button press.

This project is in the middle of a refactorx2, once to bring it up to speed with the current versions of everthing, that is [Catfork2](https://github.com/stefanbemelmans/Catfork2) and another version [ts-Catfork2](https://github.com/stefanbemelmans/ts-catfork2) which is refactored in TypeScript. Everything is a work in progress.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
# Cat Fork Rises!

This project is my goto to test new features of React. I am in the process of connecting with Firebase RTD and implementing Google Auth. Then the plan is refactor using Hooks, just for fun.
